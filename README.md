# Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM)
Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) aims to predict the power consumption of domestic appliances in a household only knowing the aggregated power load. Various neural network architectures exist for this task. This notebook contains my experiments using the architecture described in **"[Improving Non-Intrusive Load Disaggregation through an Attention-Based Deep Neural Network](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/14/4/847)" (Piccialli, Veronica and Sudoso, Antonio M., 2021)** paper.

An Arduino project is also included, that can be used to collect data of your household. It dumps the measurements to the serial port, so use e.g. a Raspberry Pi to collect the results. It is suggested to experiment more with model quantization in case running it on the Raspberry Pi (TFLite produced poor results for me). I used an ESP32, as it has a 12-bit ADC. The AC voltage sensor (ZMPT101B) is connected to the internal ADC. An external ADC (ADS1220, 24-bit) was used for the current transformer (WCS1800). The ADS1220 is configured to use an external voltage source as reference (5V), as the used current transformer has the widest linear response (0-35A) at Vdd=5V. The sensitivity of the current transformer is highly dependent on Vdd, so additional calibration might be required (macros).
